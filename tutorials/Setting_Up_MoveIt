#In order to set up Moveit, there are a couple steps. See https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/sdk-docs/wiki/#MoveIt-Tutorial for Rethink's tutorial. 

#cd to your catkin workspace, and then run:

$ git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_robots.git

#this will pull the necessary configs. 
#Now you have to install MoveIt.

$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-moveit-full

Now Moveit is installed and configured.

#This assumes you have pulled our directory and have it in a working catkin workspace. 

#You'll have to get the SDK dependancies - run:
$ sudo apt-get install python-wstool python-rosdep

#Then you'll need to get the baxter SDK set up. Navigate to the /src folder in your workspace and:

$ wstool init .
$ wstool merge https://raw.github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter/master/baxter_sdk.rosinstall
$ wstool update
$ cd ..
$ source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
$ catkin_make

#now all of the files are there. The next step is to edit the Bashrc. Add:

source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
source / **Catkin_ws Path** /devel/setup.bash
export ROS_HOSTNAME= ** "pc-name".local ** (for example, corey-pc.local)
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://baxtette.local:11311
